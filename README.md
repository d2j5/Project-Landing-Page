# Project-Landing-Page
Project landing page Assignment
For this project, you’ll create a web page from a design we’ll provide you. If you’ve been following along, you should have the skills you need to accomplish this, but it may not be easy!

 

Go here for the full instructions: https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-landing-page Links to an external site. 

 

The design we’re providing you comes in the form of 2 images: one is an image of the complete website, and one has some details about some of the fonts and colors we’ve used.

Do not be afraid to use google or go back to previous lessons to look something up. Real-life professional developers use google constantly for things they have been doing for years. At this point, it is not expected that you will have everything memorized, so don’t worry about it.


Get your project as close to the design as possible, but do not worry about getting it pixel-perfect. Don’t get out your ruler or count pixels to find the exact margins between the various sections. The point of this assignment is to create something from scratch and get the various elements in more or less the right position relative to the rest.

 

The Assignment:
Download the design images and take a look at what you’re going to be creating here.

There are many ways to tackle a project like this, and it can be overwhelming to look at a blank HTML document and not know where to start. Our suggestion: take it one section at a time. The website you’re creating has 4 main sections (and a footer), so pick one and get it into pretty good shape before moving on. Starting at the top is always a solid plan.
For the section you’re working on, begin by getting all the content onto the page before beginning to style it. In other words, do the HTML and then do the CSS. You’ll probably have to go back to the HTML once you start styling, but bouncing back and forth from the beginning will make things take longer and may end up causing you more frustration.
Do not worry about making your project look nice on a mobile device. We’ll learn that later.
Once completed, please push your code onto a repo and host it using GitHub Pages.
